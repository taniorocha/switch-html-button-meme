# Meme: The Switch Button of UX Design vs. Development

Welcome to the **UX vs Development Switch Button** project! This is a playful meme that highlights the contrast between the ease and joy of designing a user experience (UX) and the frustrations developers face while coding it. Inspired by the viral video where a UX designer is happily singing while designing, and the developer is swearing and struggling through the actual implementation.

## Overview

This project is a **switch button** inspired by the meme that visually represents the difference between UX design and development. The button's behavior mimics the transition from a joyful and smooth UX design process to the grueling and complex world of development.

### Meme Concept:

- **Design Phase (UX)**: The designer is having fun, sketching away, and everything looks easy and perfect.
- **Development Phase (Dev)**: The developer, however, is stressed, swearing, and having to deal with all the tricky coding and bugs that come with making the design work.

## Photos from the Video

Here are three images from the original video that capture the essence of the meme:

*The dramatic transition between the joyful UX phase and the frustrating Dev phase.*

## Features

- **Interactive Switch Button**: A button that toggles between two states:
  1. **UX Mode**: Everything is bright, happy, and simple.
  2. **Dev Mode**: It turns chaotic, with error messages, frustration animations, and a much darker theme.
  
- **Responsive Design**: The button is responsive, so the UX and Dev states adapt to different screen sizes.
  
- **CSS Animations**: Fun animations that make the transition from "UX" to "Dev" more entertaining.

## Demo

You can see the meme in action by checking out the live demo (link to demo if applicable). When you switch between the two modes, you'll feel the frustration of coding and the bliss of designing!
